1)Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string.

2)Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a database because it is faster to find the item using the shorter hashed key than to find it
using the original value.

3)Encryption is the practice of scrambling information in a way that only someone with a corresponding key can unscramble 
and read it.Encryption is a two-way function. 

4)When you encrypt something, youâ€™re doing so with the intention of decrypting it later.



Message Digest Algorithm 5


1)Message Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5) is a cryptographic hash algorithm that can be used to create a 128-bit string value from an arbitrary 
  length string.
2)Although there has been insecurities identified with MD5, it is still widely used.

3)MD5 is most commonly used to verify the integrity of files.
